This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
sprinters <- read.csv("sprinters.csv")
```

```{r}
sprinters_orig <- sprinters[sprinters$year<2005,]
sprinters_orig <- filter(sprinters, year<2005)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE} 
lm(time ~ year + women, data = sprinters_orig) 
lm(time ~ year * women, data = sprinters_orig) 
lm(time ~ year, data = filter(sprinters_orig, women == 1)) 
lm(time ~ year, data = filter(sprinters_orig, women == 0)) 
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
